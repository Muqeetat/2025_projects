Simple Project: Neighborhood Waste Collection Tracker
Problem:

Project Idea:
Build a simple API-based system that allows residents to check the waste collection schedule for their area and report missed pickups.

Baby Steps to Build It:
Define Requirements & Scope
Users should be able to check collection schedules.
