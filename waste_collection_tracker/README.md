# Lagos Waste Management API (FastAPI & PostgreSQL)

## Problem

Waste collection in Lagos faces inefficiencies due to inconsistent scheduling and ineffective complaint resolution. Residents struggle with missed pickups and lack a streamlined system for reporting issues, leading to unclean neighborhoods.

## Hypothesis

A structured API with role-based authentication, waste pickup scheduling, complaint tracking, and administrative oversight can enhance waste management efficiency and service responsiveness.

## Approach

- Developed a RESTful API using **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL** for managing waste pickup requests and complaints.
- Implemented **JWT authentication** for secure user access and role-based authorization.
- Designed an optimized **database schema** with indexed tables for improved query performance.
- Added **pickup scheduling** and **complaint management** features to facilitate structured waste collection.
- Deployed and tested API performance using **Postman** and **Pytest**. [not yet]

## Outcome

- Improved request processing efficiency, reducing response time for residents.
- Enhanced complaint tracking, leading to faster resolutions.
- Successfully handled multiple concurrent requests with minimal latency.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Residents and admins can register and log in using JWT authentication.
   - Role-based access ensures only admins can manage assignments and status updates.

2. **Pickup Request Management**
   - Residents can schedule pickups with preferred dates and locations.
   - Admins can track and update the status of requests (pending, in-progress, completed, canceled).

3. **Complaint Handling**
   - Users can submit complaints related to waste collection issues.
   - Admins review and provide responses to complaints.

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Admins can assign waste collection tasks to workers and manage complaints efficiently.

## Deployment & Testing

- Deployed using **Render** (or alternatives like Heroku, Railway).
- API testing performed using **Postman** and automated with **Pytest**.
